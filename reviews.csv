mccanns instant oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it there is no escaping the fact however that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation still the mccanns is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal its even better than the organic allnatural brands i have tried all the varieties in the mccanns variety pack taste good it can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issuebr br mccanns use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff one thing i do not like though is mccanns use of thickeners oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum but this is a convenience product maybe the guar gum is why after sitting in the bowl a while the instant mccanns becomes too thick and gluey,Positive
this is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand it uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup so not only does it have a better sweetness but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you great on a cold morning when you dont have time to make mccanns steel cut oats the apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too plus they dont require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart,Positive
instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl mccanns instant oatmeal holds its texture has excellent flavor and is good for you all at the same time mccanns regular oat meal is excellent too but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning this is the best instant brand ive ever eaten and a very close second to the noninstant varietybr br mccanns instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apples cinnamon and maple brown sugar 10count boxes pack of 6,Positive
mccanns instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apples cinnamon and maple brown sugar 10count boxes pack of 6br br im a fan of the mccanns steelcut oats so i thought id give the instant variety a try i found it to be a hardy meal not too sweet and great for folks like me postbariatric surgery who need food that is palatable easily digestible with fiber but wont make you bloat,Positive
for those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store i love mccanns instant oatmeal all flavorsbr br thanksbr abby,Positive
what else do you need to know oatmeal instant make it with a half cup of lowfat milk and add raisinsnuke for 90 seconds more expensive than kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something its still just oatmeal mmm convenient,Positive
i was visiting my friend nate the other morning for coffee he came out of his storage room with a packet of mccanns instant irish oatmeal he suggested that i try it for my own use in my stash sometimes nate dose not give you a chance to say no so i ended up trying the apple and cinn found it to be very tastefull when made with water or powdered milk it goes good with oj and coffee and a slice of toast and your ready to take on the worldor the day at least jerry reith,Positive
i ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter she has this almost every morning and likes all flavors shes happy im happybr a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb001eo5qw8mccanns instant irish oatmeal variety pack of regular apples cinnamon and maple brown sugar 10count boxes pack of 6a,Positive
the variety packs taste greatbr br i have them every morning at 030 cents per meal i dont understand why everyone on earth isnt buying this stuff upbr br maple and brown sugar is terrific followed by apples and cinnamon followed by regular you dont get tired of the same ole thing and they taste greatbr br i just boil water from a small pot empty the packet or 2 in a bowl pour in boiling water and watch it expand to 2x its sizebr br taste really good and takes minutes to preparebr br not sure why everyone on earth isnt this convenient healthy very quick excellent quality and extremely cheap,Positive
mccanns makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour to the sloth addled instant which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes its all good thats for sure and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regularbr this variety pack allows different tastes to be explored as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between mccanns and other wellknown oatmeals what i personally like about mccanns is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in america the apples cinnamon though tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add in my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twentyseven seconds so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to usebr the only bad thing if you can consider it a bad thing about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so youll end up with six tencount boxes this is good if you have a whole family of oatmealeaters but if youre a single person alone well love oatmeal,Positive
i have mccanns oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from amazon i am able to save almost 300 per boxbr it is a great product tastes great and very healthy,Positive
mccanns oatmeal is a good quality choice our favorite is the apples and cinnamon but we find that none of these are overly sugary for a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes this is excellent,Positive
we really like the mccanns steel cut oats but find we dont cook it up too oftenbr this tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenientbr anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing,Positive
this seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands but it is somewhat mushy and doesnt have quite as much flavor either it didnt pass muster with my kids so i probably wont buy it again,Neutral
good oatmeal i like the apple cinnamon the best though i wouldnt follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste that could just be me since i like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of,Positive
the flavors are good however i do not see any differce between this and oaker oats brand they are both mushy,Neutral
i really like the maple and brown sugar flavor the regular is fine with brown sugar added the apples and cinnamon flavor is ok this is a very quick easy and satisfying breakfast and ill order this brand again but not the variety ill get all maple and brown sugar,Positive
this is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores there is nothing healthy about it it is just carbs and sugars save your money and get something that at least has some taste,Neutral
this oatmeal is not good its mushy soft i dont like it quaker oats is the way to go,Negative
got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix i bought from the seller and the advertising workedlol i tried them and shared them with 2 buddies and we all loved them so im here to buy more and noticed there were no reviews yet well now there is they are hot but not burn your mouth forever hot its a nice temp perfect for us,Positive
this wasnt in stock the last time i looked i had to go to the vermont country store in weston to find it along with a jaw harp cranberry horseradish sauce fartless black bean salsa apple cider jelly newtons cradle art in motion and the staple vermont maple syrupbr br back to the ass kickin peanuts they are hot they will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms it requires a beverage as advertised a glass of very cold milk and a box of kleenex since it will make your nose run they look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work i suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence especially my colleague greg im going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary planters peanuts can and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when i returnbr br the can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed it is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyesbr br youll go nuts over these asskickin peanutsbr br ps im not sharing the peanuts not deliberately and ill probably give greg the jaw harp for christmas hell be so insulted,Positive
were used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy doubt very much habanero is used at all could take it up a notch or two,Neutral
i roast at home with a stovetop popcorn popper but i do it outside of course these beans coffee bean direct green mexican altura seem to be wellsuited for this method the first and second cracks are distinct and ive roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time the aroma is strong and persistent the taste is smooth velvety yet lively,Positive
we roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill about 13 of the bag at a time the smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too more importantly the coffee is smooth no bitter aftertaste on numerous occasions weve had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much,Positive
deal was awesome arrived before halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters i love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local stores candy,Positive
it is chocolate what can i say great variety of everything our family loves with a family of six it goes fast here perfect variety kit kat reeses take five and more,Positive
great product nice combination of chocolates and perfect size the bags had plenty and they were shipped promptly the kids in the neighborhood liked our candies,Positive
halloween is over but i sent a bag to my daughters class for her share the chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many,Positive
watch your prices with this while the assortment was good and i did get this on a gold box purchase the price for this wasbr 34 less at target,Neutral
this bag of candy online is pretty expensive it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores other than that its a good combination of my favorite candy,Positive
arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags,Negative
i have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder not overly tasty but quite effective as i never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides same for desert racing in the buggy the camelbaks were always laced with the powder now we have the fizzwhat a great product firstly its hammers endurolyte product so its great endurance athletes the world over use their products second its convenient handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz third it tastes great imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a salty taste you get a refreshing lemonlime or mango the camelbaks always get the fizz now i also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever i exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes i cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough,Positive
this product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ridebr i have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor no aftertaste and i actually like the slight carbonationbr i use other hammer products and really like their whole product line,Positive
this stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides pop 1 into each water bottle and youre set flavor is fine and goes down easy,Positive
for those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thingbr br two years ago i started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat i was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue gatorade wasnt an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so i looked around for a lowcarb alternative the zero carb sports drinks didnt help so what to do one day i ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of themvoilaproblem solvedbr br ive shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using thesebr br these guys got it right they are superbly formulated and simply work,Positive
i purchased the mango flavor and to me it doesnt take like mango at all there is no hint of sweetness and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice ive been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades so im familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products ive tried the mango flavor is one of the least appealing ive tasted its not terrible but its bad enough that i notice the bad taste every sip i take,Negative
if youre impulsive like me then 6 is ok dont get me wrong the quality of these babies is very good and i have no complaints but in retrospect the price is a little ridiculous esp when you add on the shipping,Neutral
this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds my fault,Positive
these albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality the bears even have little faces at my local candy store this type of gummi stuff bears rings snakes balls worms whatever are about 10lb these twin packs of 45 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as im concerned im probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin things consumed,Positive
grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area in fact pretty much anyone i talk to about grape gummy bears they think im lying so i bought 10lbs these bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick but nothing to strong i love grape flavored candysoda and these are pretty good there is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion but these are well worth it for the price i like to use the gummy bears in home made popsicles with flavored sports drink the salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles and the gummy bears are awesome frozen they are delicious,Positive
i ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from fantasicakes website for a dinner party i was hosting it arrived fresh and intact very good size i froze half for later use i am a pastry lover and these were the best ive ever tasted the pastry was soft the jam was really good and the taste was great they were gone in no time my guests were really impressed,Positive
buyer beware please this sweetener is not for everybody maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body you will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience nausea diarrhea headaches can also be experienced i learned my lesson the hard way years ago when i fell in love with the sugarfree chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell i thought id found sugarfree chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in the discomfort was unlike anything i had ever felt before i blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping as the symptoms passed this too was very unpleasant though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit all symptoms were gone when i stopped eating the chocolate my hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when i purchased some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market the taste was amazing and while i was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy new sugarfree treat taste so good my heart sank when i followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letters thank goodness id eaten only a little i still ended up with all the same sideeffects but for a much shorter duration some people can use maltitol to their hearts content but others like me can have a bad reaction to it in case youre like me its not you its the maltitol,Negative
it is okay i would not go out of my way to buy it again,Negative
no tea flavor at all just whole brunch of artifial flavors it is not returnable i wasted 20 bucks,Negative
these looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix unfortunately they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate i left them in my pantry for a few days and when i opened them at room temperature they were still gooey i through them in the fridge and ive been breaking off hunks ever since they taste good to me but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again i wont order them online again but if i see them in a store i would pick them up,Positive
these taste really good i have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture i agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer there is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items order in cold weather and buy enough to last,Positive
the taste was great but the berries had melted may order again in winter if you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor,Neutral
i know i cannot make tea this good granted i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet it tastes crisp,Positive
this peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat my dad got me one for christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when i was a little girl im 30 now and i love it,Positive
great gift for all ages i purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much they kept them and would not eat them,Positive
i know the product title says molecular gastronomy but dont let that scare you off i have been looking for this for a while now not for food science but for something more down to earth i use it to make my own coffee creamerbr br i have to have my coffee blonde and sweet but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat and honestly i hate to use manufactured food items i really dont think they are good for the body on the other hand i hate using cold milk or cream because i like hot coffeebr br i stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer i also bought lowfat noninstant milk powder and regular milk powder the noninstant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant lowfat milk but does not dissolve good in cold water which is not a problem for hot coffee you will have to play with the ratios i would not do just the heavy cream it made the coffee too rich also i think the powder is too expensive to just use on its own i like mixing 13 of each togetherbr br for flavoring i bough cocoa bean powder vanilla bean powder and caster superfine sugar i mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers if you wanted you could use a fake sweetner powder instead i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning jars i also use my little food chopperfood processor to blend everything so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom let it settle for a bit before opening the top thoughbr br this stuff tastes way better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolateorange mixbr br all of the ingredients i mentioned are here online take the time to experiment maybe you dont use any lowfat milk or dont add any flavorings it is up to you also would make great housewarminghostess giftsbr br i am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it and i am sure i will experiment with it in cooking but the main reason i bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great,Positive
while my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food for some reason their itching increased when i tried the lamb and rice i have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help the duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again i like natural balance for the quality ingredients,Neutral
awesome dog food however when given to my boston who has severe reactions to some food ingredients his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night scratching as soon as i changed to a different formula the scratching stopped so glad natural balance has other choices i guess you have to try each until you find whats best for your pet,Neutral
we have three dogs and all of them love this food we bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him no more hot spots or tummy problemsbr i love that it ships right to our door with free shipping,Positive
my dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food she was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has after we got the test back we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand so i finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this she still has her environmental triggers but i am happy she can finally eat something i know wont cause her pain,Positive

natural balance dry dog food lamb meal and brown rice recipe did wonders for my jack russell she has awful food allergys and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didnt have something in it that she was allergic to she has no problem eating it dry but normally i mix the natural balance dry lamb and brown rice with the natural balance wet lamb and brown rice she seems to like that better we started feeding it to our other dog a bichon too and she loves it if your dog has allergys or stomach issue or if you want your dog to eat better food this is it you will see a difference in your pet,Positive

this food is great all ages dogs i have a 3 year old and a puppy they are both so soft and hardly ever get sick the food is good especially when you have amazon prime shipping,Positive
my golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs ive ever met after experimenting with various types of food i have found she loves natural balance what i really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties i mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it furthermore i do like mixing up the flavors each time as i think the same meal day over day might get a little boring so i figured why not i tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smellsbr br additionally i started purchasing off amazon because petco didnt have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans i came home and to my surprise realized that i could save 20 each time i bought dog food if i just buy it off amazonbr br all in all i definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food while i have never eaten it my dog seems to love it,Positive
this is the same food we get at pet store but its delivered to my door and for the same price or slightly less,Positive
ive been very pleased with the natural balance dog food our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and i had someone recommend natural balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains since switching i havent had any issues it is also helpful that have have different kibble size for largersmaller sized dogs,Positive
my 112 year old basenjijack russell mix loves this dog food hes been noticeably healthier and more energetic since i switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year despite the higher cost of natural dog foods i find that he eats significantly less of the natural balance dog foods and still stays happy and full on the normal dog foods hed eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day the recommended serving for his size whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 112 cup of the natural balance dog food a day when you take this into account youre actually getting more bang for your buck with the natural dog foods since you dont have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods and a healthier happier dog to boot add in the fact that you can get free 2day shipping with amazon prime im sold,Positive
our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods the cheap you can buy it anywhere food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets this food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the foodbr this message is ramsey frankenstein approved,Positive
my english bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3 the vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him iams lamb and rice and onto a new kind this was the second one we tried and it has been working ever since its for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food like chicken or beef,Positive
i fed this to my golden retriever and he hated it he wouldnt eat it and when he did it gave him terrible diarrhea we will not be buying this again its also super expensive,Negative

im presently on a diet and i was at my fresh and easy neighborhood grocery looking over possible diet foods i wanted things that were tasty nonfat and low in calories i came home with about a dozen items thats how i discovered the tillen farms pickled crispy asparagus well ive always liked asparagus anyway and ive enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus this tillen farms brand is really really good its the best i can recall theres an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in the bottom of the jar which im looking forward to eating i cant believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says only 60 calories per jar now this is my idea of a good diet foodbr br gary peterson,Positive
i was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix i usually like most of the low carb things i have tried but was diappointed in this specific one,Negative
i have been drinking this tea for a long time now i used to have to purchase it at a doctors office because it wasnt available elsewhere im so glad that i can buy it now from amazoncom i drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee wonderful taste,Positive
i have been drinking royal king 100 natural organic green tea 100 tea bags x 2g each as my every day tea for several years now i buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping for many years i used to drink coffee from morning till night but finally i realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me i finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together i tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit i found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier coffe and other drinks do not the only healthier drink is quality cold water in my opinion for the price royal king 100 natural organic green tea is one of the best tasting teas this green tea has a beautiful golden color the taste is bright and fresh i recommend adding a tiny amount of ys organic bee farms raw honey to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too i also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea tribute xi hu long jing but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea although i would if i could afford itbr br cons on my latest shipment the package shown on the amazon page is different than the one shipped the one shipped displays naturally high in polyphenol catechins a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea whereas the amazon package displays caffene free so i am not sure if this green tea is caffene free or not the other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when i unwrap the string from around the tea bag so if the string seems stuck to the tea bag i put the bag in the hot water to unstick it,Positive
this has to be one of the best teas i have ever tasted its clean bright freshbr br great deliveryagain quality just try it,Positive
i love love this green tea it is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and i usually dont get as many boxes as i did with this merchant i will definitely order from this seller again thanks i depend on my green tea fix everyday,Positive
i love this tea it helps curb my eating during the day my mom and i have given it all friends to try,Positive
im italian and i lived in italy for years i used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an italian espresso i couldnt find them anywhere here in the bay area so its great to have them again,Positive
in the 1980s i spent several summers in italy this biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or midday snack they are simple and delicious and were not sold in the us back then they are so good that i brought back two bags from a recent trip to italy it is great to see that they may now be found on amazonbr br note it is great to open a bag smell the contents pour a glass of milk then dip the macines in the milk great routine and treat for kids,Positive
i had heard a little about this product from the local pet store then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively the female younger one took to it right away and the older male who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc in it and would usually refuse a diet change actually liked it too the older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctors request but he totally refused it he is a posh cat after all he still consumes too many calories the fatty but at least i know hes eating good food of course i know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market but i just cant see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there marketed as being healthy why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal is that right ill stay with this for now but stay tunedbr br im updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats i upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them garfield still eats a little too much but hes just a big cat who doesnt exercise much lets face it our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and shes so healthy shes tiny but happy and agile i tried the chicken version of holistic select but garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one ive ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it,Positive
i started buying this after i noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his spunk so i decided it was time to start buying him real cat foodnot the garbage in the super markets i found this at the pet store out of the other million choices and im sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one i went with to try first and it was a great purchase my cat has been on this for the past 8 months and hes now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft mainly he loved the taste even more i highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals,Positive
i have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat and this is an excellent food that is also according to my holistic veterinarian they put probiotics on the kibble as the last step which is very important to me the best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and i had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat holistic select,Positive
this cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old cleo cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight it stopped her problems she doesnt eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price it aids in digestion since theok sorrysmells are gone if ya know what i mean had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food,Positive
i have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections i feed him this dry food in combination with wet food with water added to it and uri ease the combination seems to keeps his utis under control if i switch to another type of dry food his uti gets worse the other cats seem to enjoy this food as well its expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me,Positive
before i was educated about feline nutrition i allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food i always offered both canned and dry but wish i would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food i have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats the only good quality dry foods they will eat are wellness and innova innovas manufacturer was recently purchased by proctergamble i began looking for a replacement after once again offering several samples from my local holistic pet store holistic select was the only one other than the usual wellness and innova they would eat for finicky cats i recommend trying holistic select it is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters,Positive
my holistic vet recommended this along with a few other brands we tried them all but my cats prefer this especially the sardine version the best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear and and i dont want to be rude so ill say this as delicately as i can their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the mcdonalds junk found in most stores which is a definite plus for me the health benefits are so obvious i highly recommend holistic select,Positive
one of my cats is allergic to fish and beef this formula is one of the few she can eat and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet both of my kitties are very active have soft shiny fur and neither are fat dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth also,Positive
our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food they definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great they are fit and not over weight this vendor ships extremely fast is one of the top amazon suppliers in our book,Positive
ive been a fan of hot spicy maruchan ramen for a long time if you enjoy spice and love ramen youll love this product too bad its way too expensive here on amazon its only 336 per 12 at my walmart,Positive
ive been eating ramen noodles since i was a little kid and ive never found a better flavor than hot spicy chicken it isnt hot at all to a chilihead like me but it sure is good,Positive
i love spicy ramen but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesnt go away for like 3 hours not sure if that is healthy or not and you can buy this at walmart for 028 way cheaper than amazon,Neutral
always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in,Positive
i must be a bit of a wuss because this soup tastes to me how i imagine fire might taste typically i like spicy food if it has a good flavor i dont find this to be the case with this soup any flavor is killed off by the burn,Negative
i really loved the spicy flavor these had i found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite if you arent used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough,Positive
got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup which is half the price of my local grocery stores plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors these things are a great snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you cant escape for a real meal this is one of my favorite flavors of instant lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale,Positive
i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon,Positive
i love this flavor of ramen i dont eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison for the convenience of having it delivered to my home i have prime so i get it in two days and dont have to pay for the shipping the price on amazon isnt bad at all but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store,Positive
the best investment ive ever made for ginger its unbelievable its fibrous like the real ginger has that spicy kick to it but its perfect with the sugar calms it down its very worth the 40 for 5lbs of it ill be getting more soon i use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies,Positive
delicious i cannot get australian ginger where i live this compares favorably to australian ginger ive purchased in other cities now i can enjoy it without traveling,Positive
i keep trying other brands cheaper brands stupid me this ginger is soooo worth the money tender moist and never a let down,Positive
my son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and i automatically ordered it for him i was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried what a surprise he has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this ginger each morning he can now eat anything and actually enjoy it this product was a god send for him thank you all for it,Positive
i bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on because its bite size its easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick my only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping,Positive
twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brandbr if you can get these for 2 to 250 a package with free sh its a good dealbr the black and cherry have good taste but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there,Positive
i love thesevery tasty infact i think i am addicted to thembr buying them in packs of 6 bags is very reasonable than going to target and getting a bag savings are about a 100 a bag i use subscribe and save on these and several other product i love subscribe and save,Positive
if you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children then be sure to try these theyre soft easy to chew and they dont get your hands all sticky and gross in the car in the summer at the beach etc we love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack great item great price too highly recommend,Positive
i might be mistaken but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size if they did do that it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal having so many pieces after all the problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience as it is you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size it is not the same,Neutral
being a fan of newmans pineapple salsa for quite a while i was looking for a comparable salsa this is one of the best tasting salsas ive ever had my daughters love it too they dont like super chunky salsa and the berry mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces the salsa is not too sweet just sweet enough and although its mild it has a nice little kick to it at this price its a steal,Positive
the salsa smelled delicious as i think it probably was but unfortunately the person at amazon that is a packer there is probably several had very little stuffing to work with especially on the bottoms therefore the bottoms were broken on all three bottles as i reached for my computer i was told no returns cause its a food item i then looked for a customer service tag and i found none on their new face lift they seem to be proud of their new face lift butthey should at least have a place to contact them in emergencies like i buy a lot of stuff and it all comes in styrofoam boxes never would i ship thingsbr especially salsa in a cardboard box with just a stripe of large bubble wrap on it no matter how much the carrier fed ex is careful its going to break somewhere along the line especially in an all glass container barbara l s,Negative
this is one of the best salsas that i have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack the other two that come with it are not worth your money,Positive
these remind me of dog treats i made once using pumpkin and cinnamon theyre kind of bland and not my favorite back to nature product but my finace really loves them so thats where the three stars come from,Neutral
this is the best cornmeal i made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding also fried some oysters with this meal it gave them a great texture and flovor,Positive
this is a fabulous marinade i love to use it for chicken either baked in the oven or on the grill this has enough flavor flair ive even used it for dinner parties only to receive rave reviews from my guests definitely worth the price super cheap and super easy love it,Positive
works with chicken fish beef or pork fast easy and makes it taste excellent plus buying in bulk is more than 50 off from box stores,Positive
got this for my brother who is on jorge cruise diet and decided to try one for myself it actually tastes pretty good,Positive
these singles sell for 250 336 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles im not sure why amazon is selling it for 999 for a box of 24 singles hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite but truly this is not a good buy,Negative
awesome such a yummy flavor i got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and i am so glad that i did there are so many things you can do with jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you i will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful,Positive
i went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here this jello is wonderful evidently its only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the fall i couldnt find it anywhere in town this jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe i made with it takes like watermelon jam great made as regular jello too yummy,Positive
what a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use this box should last our family the year no problem iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will,Positive
perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket we love it shakes well no clumping and flows freely,Positive
span classtiny length 026 minsbr br spanthe expiration date is 21 months from the day i bought this product the tuna tomato combination is delicious this is one of the many items i reorder on amazon every month or sobr edit added a short video so you see what this combination looks likebr br i was wearing one of those headlamps but i didnt do a good job focusing on the tunabr i should film it over but it doesnt look like many people view this product anyway,Positive
ive never heard of the safcol brand before but i was tired of only trying the typical pouches starkist and chicken of the sea i was really surprised as i thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning,Positive
these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion make a great on the go snack and really satisfying with the tomato,Positive
i have always purchased starkist tuna but thought i would try this brand for a change of pace the taste of the tuna was not pleasant too much basil and other spices for me,Neutral
im not familiar with the safcol brand but being a tuna addict gave this a shot the tuna tastes like its good quality but i found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland its better than something plain but it didnt pack the punch i was hoping for its still a great option for a low calorie low fat meal,Positive
i found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there excellent quality and no need to dress it upbr br i put it the micro on about 20 power for 1 minute and shazambr br i believe a little heating brings out the flavor,Positive
seriously this product was as tasteless as they come there are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack you just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor,Negative
i read about pomegranate molasses so i had to try it i havent made anything with it yet just eaten a little bit at a time but wow is it decadent its dark syrupy sour and a little sweet a dab of this and i forget about dessert its just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone yum im going to try making fesenjan next,Positive
used this in moroccan recipes as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water wonderful wonderful stuff,Positive
i dont know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere but they were so old that they wouldnt cook i had to throw half of them out because the skins were damaged a clear sign of dried beans past their prime i cant even return these or ask for a refund because food is not returnable will find a different brand to use for now i have about fifty servings of beans to throw away,Negative
besides being smaller than runts they look the same and have the same consistency unfortunately they taste nothing like banana runtsnor do they even taste good yucky stuff trying to return with vendor,Negative
the item over all was fine but the banana heads are not just like banana runts they are alot smaller also when i received the item the packaging was not great the banana heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope,Neutral
i purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with jungle theme they worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy i purchased 5 if you want more than 25 small bags i would purchase a larger bag,Positive
i have drunk ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine i love this stuff in milkbr its much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk i am french and live in the usbr and bring back boxes of ricore at every opportunity savora is another hidden gem you can bringbr back check it out,Positive
i first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in brittany france and thought it was delicious i wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that i love this product,Positive
i couldnt wait to try the 88243 cinnamon coffee cake because it is made with fresh eggs creamy sour cream madagascar bourbon vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel this 88243 cinnamon coffee cake is available online for only 1895 now i have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes but let me just tell you that the fantasicakes cinnamon coffee cake really takes the cake with size price quality and tastebr the cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition it also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top before serving i couldnt believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast for three days the cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling the flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake the icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor pair the cake with your morning coffee and youve got the perfect breakfast treat,Positive
i used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 56 years ago this stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going it feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong the stronger it is the less you use as well the product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost i thought these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad this is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like,Positive
one of the best lemon juice that i have tried i am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product when the season for fresh lemos is out this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshmentsbr br i will continue buying it,Positive
this lemon juice is a must in my kitchen yearround it has a powerful flavor and you dont need much of it to zest up a dish i add a spritz of it to my water nearly every daybr br i will buy this product again and again,Positive
fast delivery and good product this is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and its really handy to have around to add to sauces dressings etc such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with,Positive
this is not as good as the frozen lemon juice but it is good it has a slightly odd flavor perhaps from a preservative sure wish i could order the frozen juice,Positive
couldnt believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was seriously drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime if you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommendedbr br i feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation after a short time my eyes start to get droopy and i am in another placebr br love this stuff,Positive
i bought these at grocery outlet here in the seattle tacoma are for 400 a case of tweleve not paying 3800 yes 3 for a dollar i like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price,Positive
this is an great product the taste is great and it works exactly as described superb natural sleep aid amazing,Positive
we have been looking for natural ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule yes wed probably be better served taking a yoga class but this is a good second choice this helps you fall asleep and stay asleep i drank half the first night and that was plenty for me after about 30 minutes i was ready for bed i woke up refreshed and with no sleepydrug hangover so that is a huge bonusbr br i gave the product 3 stars instead of the 5 it deserves as their packing job was marginal at best the product arrived with 2 broken bottles which at this price is a 6 loss the bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the smallbubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box big packing fail but the product is awesome,Neutral
we made chocolate chip cookies with brm garbanzo bean flour and the results were fantastic the brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned our friends couldnt discern any difference from classic cccs the texture body and elasticity meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other glutenfree flours is nice and chewy the same as cccs made with regular flour and an added bonus the high protein and fiber level i calculate 23 g fibercookie fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lowerbr br i highly recommend this flour even if cccs are the only thing you make with it,Positive
this is great stuff made some really tasty banana bread good quality and lowest price in town,Positive
we had trouble finding this locally delivery was fast no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores,Positive
this packet of glaze is the secret to making those european style fresh fruit tarts i am about to make one for a pie auction at church after a friend requested that something strawberry should be offered you can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit tarts by baking a base layering it with uncooked fresh sliced fruit then pouring over the madeup contents of one of these packets they harden up at room temperature hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through ive also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes to hold a fruit topping in place personally i do not like cheesecake too rich for me but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous i will admit to do this slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while its still in the springform pan pour on the glaze let it set up and then remove the springform youll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake cherries strawberries or sliced mangos are nice but the best one i ever had used thin slices of lemons that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cakebr br i use a base of sponge cake baked in a shallow form but other bases can be pate sucre a kind of french pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie that works well in those fluted straightsided forms you can also make minitarts in a muffin pan prebaking each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust works though again i prefer pate sucre it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb just blindbake the muffin tins lined with pate then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits berries are great and pour over the glaze some people put a layer of creme patisserie which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour below the fruit and i happen to think these taste bestbr br if you get into baking this glaze is a musthave on the shelf the ingredients are vegan tapioca starch carrageenan dextrose cream of tartar locust bean gum so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake you can use this on top as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base,Positive
my scotties were full of hot spots and when i used this within a week all the hot spots were gone the smell is kinda strong but not bad its tolerablel,Positive
i bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants i didnt expect it to taste good but it actually does ive only had it for a few days and for 5 its totally worth it my sisters all take ganocafe but now im introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee i will follow up on this product in a few weeks,Positive
the coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright nescafe and mount hagen are better i bought this to try something other than these two but i probably wont get this again there is just a slight vitaminy taste but its not overwhelming its also a bit pricey for what you get,Neutral
this coffee is great because its all organic ingredients no pesticides to worry about plus it tastes good and you have the healing effects for ganoderma,Positive
like the other people mentioned this coffee has a great taste ive tried different instant coffees before but this one is one of the better ones another one of my favorites if you want to try it out though not organic is africafe pure instant coffee,Positive
tastes great and gives me energy without the jitters love this productbr however i do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a ziplock pouch because the ziplock ripped off and quit working after awhile but the product is fantastic just not crazy about the packaging,Positive
these little guys are tasty and refreshingbr br i usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath i eat 2 of these after lunch because they are so small and i find this sufficiently resolves the problembr br theyre sugar free sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow which is great and theyre tasty enough that i almost think of them as part of my lunchbr br this is a good bulk value buy and id highly recommend the mints themselves cheers,Positive
i like these better than the regular altoids but theyre even more costly so youd better like them,Positive
these little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great dealthere perfict for on the gofifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary alongand there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugarthe price of twelve dollars was very resonablealso there great for shareingif you are looking for a mint try these onesyoull be glad you did,Positive
prosbr packaging shipping pricebr sold about a year before its expiration date enough for me to eatshare 9 boxesbr not too fresh like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form its a real mintbr br cons none,Positive
be careful not to eat too many of them in one day as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a laxative lololol,Neutral
these mints are really strong and have a great taste they are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse,Positive
this is a huge supply of them im still working on these and have plenty to spare much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 711 every time you want a mint,Positive
even with small containers they dont fill them up these little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a ripoff is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares or how about the cereal ploy they were filled at the factory but settled in transportbr can manufacturers be honest in their dealings,Negative
i love and use the empty containers for medicineadvil in my purse desk suitcase also line with felt to keep earrings perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and love the mints tiny and powerful without burning my mouth,Positive
received as shown my mother in law likes these and walgreens quit carrying them it was great i could get them on amazon,Positive
i keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet when i find someone who keeps coming back for more i just give them their own tin one coworker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes like i said theyre a real hit since i wouldnt be able to keep my hands off a candy dish this is a good alternative to have around and its nice to have them around if i have garlic for lunch i gave the item 4 stars because they arent as tasty as the sugar version of the mints but what sugar free item is as good as its full sugar counterpart and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove although i totally get why they wrap it it still doesnt make it easy to deal with,Positive
the tiny altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability its full but compactbr br i havent run out yet and probably wont for a couple months but i cant wait to buy it again,Positive
i loved these wintergreen altoid smalls so much i had to come write a review the packaging is small for convenience and the altoids are smaller as well with a square shape blue hue and even more delicious taste in my opinion i definitely prefer them over the regularsize altoids and will continue purchasing them highly recommended,Positive
fresh scent and taste easy to eat one tin in few hours i use them as favors and everyone loved them,Positive
hard to find the wintergreen smalls sugar free as stores only have the red smalls peppermint such a common flavor the wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious driving cross country if someone cuts me off i turn to my daughter with my hand out and say wintergreen me she pulls one out puts it in my hand and all is right with the world,Positive
to me these are nothing like the regular altoids and are not breath mints they are pleasanttasting little candies in a cute convenient tin and thats as far as it goes the mintiness is just not strong and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis im not a dragonbreath person but still one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath four or five will freshen my breath for a short while maybe 15 minutes at this point i think the icebreakers frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints,Negative
we have fed our cats a lot of stuff these 2 boy cats are not picky eaters they loved the purina they loved the nutro they loved the iams they love whatever we feed thembr br this review is based on what we their affectionate owners love after a certain age we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods and lower carb foods because the catties were fatties we tried a few types of food some evinced no change some made the litter superstink some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didnt have to chew it to swallow itbr br this felidae has done the trick no problems to speak of it is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose the cats love it the kibble is sized appropriate to chewing and heres the kickerbr after feeding the cats felidae their demeanor improved their coats are super soft and lush both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food were now loyal felidae consumersbr br additionally the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with catallergies,Positive
i started my cat on felidae platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it shes an older cat somewhat overweight and had a grouchy temperament i first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which she ate the felidae and left the old food shes now been on just the felidae for about ten days now off the old food entirely and she is a much sweeter happier cat i think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested or something in any case i am a happy purchaser of felidae i dont agree with the previous reviewer that cats dont like it clearly mine does,Positive
we have three cats the youngest is about eleven years old another is fifteen and our oldest is well ancient that is what the vet told us ten years ago the youngest is a blob when he lays down he looks like a footstool the other two are arthritic and skinnybr br since we had such success with canidae platinum for senior dogs i figured that wed give it a try for our cats id had them on low ash purina one urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no ut problemsbr br buster the youngest is still a blob after six months plus on felidae for senior and overweight cats however the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really feeling better since we changed their food to felidae even prissy the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her where before when she was on purina one all she wanted to do was to sleepbr br i think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems itll be more effectivebr br however the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life,Positive
too much of a good thing we worked this kibble in over time slowly shifting the percentage of felidae to national junkfood brand until the bowl was all natural by this time the cats couldnt keep it in or down what a mess weve moved on,Negative
as with canidae felidae has also changed their formula cats do not like change when it comes to their food and they just had to change it without putting it on their label we noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell as you will notice i have also reviewd the canidae and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issuesbr br prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home if cats get upset because of a change in enviorment or a loud noise they can stop eating it depends on the cat two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight we took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal it has been a year since then and they are better then the formula for this food changedbr br we started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us we asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food it wasnt until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and havent suffered one bit like our dogs havebr br cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it we have 5 rescued and fixed cats none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formulabr br i urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the fda website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal as with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals and tell me not to buy it this is just horrible,Negative
dont buy just a few of these i order these by the case i cant even remember the first time i tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but i have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite,Positive
i order these olives a lot they are unlike any other olives out there the subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses one of my favorite appetizer treats for guests,Positive
hey the description says 360 grams that is roughly 13 ounces at under 400 per can no way that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can,Negative
my husband and i are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us it definitely makes you sweat a bit when youre eating it it was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but i dont think i would buy it again due to the heat we prefer the milder mccormicks brand of fajita mix ive also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasnt as spicy as this mix isbr br if you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind to me it was more than medium hot but not by too muchbr br i gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and its versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it you take a plastic bag a couple of tbs of vegetable oil 14 cup water and mix the seasoning water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes in the meantime it says to stir fry your veggies peppers and onion but i found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and i dont think it affected quality or taste i also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oilbr br i have one more package of this to use and next time im going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more,Neutral
a friend whod been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago even took me over to the store and bought me a pound at 7lb in a retail store or a little over 9 with shipping from an online merchant i think its great ive been drinking earl grey english breakfast irish breakfast lapsang souchong assam etc most of them were over 30lb with shipping aside from the lapsang souchong i think this is a great replacement for all the rest has everything im looking for in a strong fullbodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring my current favorite afternoon tea unless youre extremely jaded or a tea snob youll love it,Positive
i love strong full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam irish breakfast or early grey tea but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging so i have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasnt bitter at a more palatable price point and this certainly fits the bill and unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another ie iced vs hot this tea is excellent in both forms i would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesnt cost an arm and leg,Positive
i drink this tea plain without sugar or milk and it has a pleasant aromabr br the price from amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store one reviewer is right i think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma so the label imperial blend kind of implied the herbbr br i am not exactly a black tea drinker so this tea is a surprise and affordable too i usually prefer white chinese tea like white peony but it is more expensive and requires lower temperature water but this is black tea and this aroma kind of remind me the softness of white tea,Positive
ive tried a variety of ahmad tea not because i particularly like this brand but they are just easier to come across the imperial blend i believe is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones ive tried its full body like a good cup of assam which by no means overpower the delightful clean taste of darjeerling complete with a long lasting note of bergamot i enjoy it best in the evening it gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy daybr br for those interested in the specifics i use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug let it steep in 208f water for 23 min take the infuser out and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication,Positive
i have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the russian custom of preparing and drinking tea and the ahmad imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced i buy the threepacks as needed from amazon and go through them rapidly my family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too try one box of it and you will love it too,Positive
this is an excellent tea one of the best i have ever had it is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar,Positive
herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste it is only for people who like herbal taste i dont,Negative
makes a tasty super easy meal fast but high in caloriesbr br the instructions say to saute the veggies first but i recommend cooking the chicken first the chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess i made it with snow peas and carrots only i dont like the little corn added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice it came out wonderful dinner on the table in less than 30mins,Positive
i think i have tried just about every bloody mary mixer on the market at one time or the other most have too much sugar or worst corn syrup this mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty it does have a little kick enjoy,Positive

this candy is not as described the middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as describedbr looks and tastes like its way past its expiration datebr would never reccommend this paid a good chunk of cash for nothing,Negative
i started drinking the power slim tea when i was on the hcg diet to help curb cravings since i liked it so well i tried some of the others and i am now hooked they are so satisfying that i drink them all the time the energy gives you that extra pickmeup in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day no matter how long,Positive
im trying several of the wu yi teas i like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste it also has a natural sweetnessbr br the ingredients include organic wuli cliff oolong tea 700 mg organic black tea 600 mg organic green tea extract 100 mg proprietary blend 600 mg plus some ginseng panax orange peel lemon grass and guarana other ingredients natual orange and citrus flavorsbr br my goal is to drink more tea and less coffee i am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day ill be coming back to this one,Positive
i cannot live without this citron falksalt it is wonderful on watermelon fish almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does just try it on red juicy watermelon wonderful experience,Positive
terrible artificial lemon taste like pledge lemon furniture polish dont do this to yourself just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest,Negative
these things are huge i love the way the crystals crunch and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle this lemony flavor is my favoriteits good on almost everything youll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this,Positive
the taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker which is not bad except that i bought them because i wanted a cheese tastebr br what was a huge disappointment how misleading the packaging of the box is the photo on the box i bought these in store makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads expanding the length and width of the box wrong the plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2 smaller all around leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreadsbr br what is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and ecofriendly packaging fail they used a huge box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers not ecofriendly at allbr br would i buy these again no i feel ripped off the other crackers like sesame tarragon give you a littlebr more bang for your buck and have more flavor,Negative
this is the ultimate puppy food the kibbles are great for small breeds high in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use less waste results from the high quality ingredients i have been hunting training showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years with multiple national champions i have been highly satisfied with eukanubas quality and the results i have obtained feeding their foods my recent purchases are with wag through amazoncom their prices are the best i have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock,Positive
the recommendation when we bought our puppies lhasabichon mix and lhasapoodle mix was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned this is a somewhat expensive food so i cant say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed homebr br let me just say this i have had small dogs before never have i seen such gas issues both of them consistently had foul gas consistently usually when theyre sitting on our laps but you know theyre dogsbr br when we got through the first bag of this stuff we purchased more on amazon it was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of i think a 15 lb bag at petco but they continued to have gas i mean they loved the food dont get me wrong and they loved it more when wed mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that made their gas worse but i think ill have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down cant blame the food itself for gluttonybr br eventually we switched their food no more farting i think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful they said up until 1 year yeah right you try dealing with gas for that long around 6 mos of age we switched to puppychow much better granted they dont like it as much but we humans like it a whole lot better,Positive
a very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertastebr br in the 20 years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the yearsbr br i am so happy to find ahmad teas available here thanks amazon because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away the current deal for the pack of 6 is superb much cheaper than i can find locallybr br this is a great tasting tea which i am happy to recommend,Positive
fresha great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories they taste just like chocolate pudding,Positive
if you like the ceylon tea variety you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this teabr br i am so happy to find ahmad teas available here thanks amazon and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20 years we have been drinking ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed the superb quality of ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the yearsbr br the current deal for the pack of 4 is very good cheaper than i can find locallybr br highly recommendedbr br note this listings description is confusing each packet of tea weighs 500 grams which equals 11 pounds or 176 ounces,Positive
ive been enjoying this tea for years this tea is good mornings afternoons or evenings my local store went out of buisinessthanks amazon i use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot,Positive
hi i have to have black tea everyday i have done it in the past 25 years and its a habit of mine ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and i highly recommend it if you like black tea i think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so,Positive
i have tried it out despite the other review and i found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either russian or italian groceries,Positive
ahmad tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea great flavor with no lingering aftertaste,Positive
ive been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas where many middleeastern stores carry loose ahmad teas usually at 57 for a pound box ive always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea with enough aroma and taste and beautiful reddish color perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own but a decent base for mixesbr this tea however is nothing of the sort freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell and the brewed tea is weak flat and tasteless somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore so you get a lot of tea for the money but the quality is such that you might as well drink lipton bags they are not that much worse,Negative
i love love love this deal its way fun to pick from so many teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees the other outfits that assemble samplers are boring they do the choosing and from a much narrower range the sellers here are very nice also and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method its easy if you want great packaging forget it they ship fast and the kups are just tossed loose in a box who cares,Positive
once youve tried some random sampler packs and now are overloaded with decafsextra bolds or teas this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what i ordered this was my second order and ill be ordering this item again,Positive
good products and fast shipping equals a happy me a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavorsa few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price,Positive
if used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack,Positive
wow this product is very impressive i bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging price and shipping the powder dissolves instantly even in water ive just been mixing a 14 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next this product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away i think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well im excited to add more of the superfoods to my diet in this fast and easy way i definitely will being trying the other flavors soon,Positive
the pork chops from omaha steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem,Neutral

i am chemical sensitive as well as sugarfree i have been using this product for over a year i use it maybe once a week at the most i drink 12 the bottle and then boost my energy after an hour or two depending on how i feel imo this doesnt replace my am coffee but is sweet in the early afternoon when i start to fade once in a while i drink a full bottle before a workout ive been drinking guayaki yerba mate teas for years compared to the many toxic energy boosters out there i highly recommend this this product is clean and doesnt leave nasty chems behind in the body try it before you judge from a review everyones body reacts differently,Positive
i felt energized within five minutes but it lasted for about 45 minutes i paid 399 for this drink i could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money,Negative
yes its probably healthier than 5hour energy or starbucks shots but if youre looking to avoid a caffeine overload this is still not for you most energy drinks cannot be made w out a high dosage of caffeine i believe the caffeine content of 1 guayaki shot is 150 ml probably lower than other unhealthy energy shot drinks but i believe most other people avoid the top brands bc they contain too much caffeine andor sugar if you do not react well to caffeine guayaki is not a good buy either i definitely feel an energy boost w 1 full guayaki shot but not w out all the other caffeine side effects irritability nervousness moodswings caffeine overdose is why i stopped drinking coffee but it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safebr br now youre not sensitive to caffeine then its a great buy its not loaded w sugar the taste is easy and pleasant its not loaded w a bunch of chemicals like 5hour shots or starbucks drinks and the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your bodyweightbr br side note if you want to feel energized during the day have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy,Negative
these nature valley nut lovers variety pack was perfect although i wasnt sure about the peanut butter bar it was excellent i loved the roasted almond roasted pecan and the peanut butterbr br i will definately buy from this seller again quick shipping and very fresh,Positive
i so wish i would have read this review before purchasing two gallons of this oil for my health issues it reeks like a chemical rubber smell this smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid when i called to report the situation to the company sabrina told me i would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab unbelievable good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund including shipping the product is faulty period i will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership,Negative
this product has a strong aftertaste of crayola crayonsbr br i am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes upon opening the plastic container the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in itbr br i suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as i have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchasedbr br to date my favorite coconut oil is distributed by barleans the flavor is fantastic however they do not supply a gallonsized tuband dr mercola has the best product in that size category,Negative
had this shipped to my sister who follows a glutenfree eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking too good product good value,Positive
these are healthy and my mixed llasa tibetan terrier adores them and they are healthy and his breath doesnt smell and his teeth are in good shape because of such products a great healthy product,Positive
a great healthy chew for my 9 wk old beagle rio he loves the taste and it sure beats my arm,Positive
i really enjoy this product i had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store once i found it i look no further its the only sugar i use thanks so much,Positive
i have used and liked sugar in the raw for many years after being introduced to it in a starbucks my most recent purchase however was disappointing the sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 14th of the regular size having large crystals was something i always really liked about sugar in the raw it enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes i called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar they have had many complaints of a similar nature this they claimed also reduced the crystal size they said this problem should go away with their newer crop the representative said that the newcrop sugar will have a 610 digit date code without any spaces that ends with a 1 and no letters the trailing digits are a date code using the julian calendar my recent badpurchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a 51a bottom line their current product is not much better than much cheaper products when they get a better crop ill go back to purchasing sugar in the raw,Neutral
sugar in the rawtm please harvest cane wo burningbr to be delivered to hcsbr dear sugar in the raw folksbr br we who buy your product care about the environment and wed like to know that you care too when you burn the cane fields on maui it adds to the co2 and worsens climate change and the smoke from your burning is damaging the lungs of your workers your workers children and the residents of mauibr br we love your product and want you to change to noburn harvesting so we can continue to buy it knowing we arent contributing to global warming and lung diseasebr br,Positive
love this sugar i also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar recommend,Positive
product is exactly as advertised what a savings at least half the retail price easy to store because of the individual packaging,Positive
i used to buy this sugar for years i do not eat much sugar but still this sugar is called turbinado sugar but is misleading i picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar and other brands in the local food store that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or somethingbr br how did i find out i needed just a sweet water few days ago i put this sugar in the raw in the glass the water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just pure white sugar crystals what a shame on the producer u can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as wellbr br im just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice,Negative
its just sugar in the raw its flavor profile is much better then white sugar and its suppose to be better for you or something i just wish the bags were resealable,Positive
this is a delicious sugar it has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma but the granules are quite big however bigger than plain refined sugar this makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together but if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it it is a great product it would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer,Positive
i only use raw sugar it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good will buy again,Positive
this sugar is very good use this in your coffee cereal etc for a week and youll never go back to white sugar white sugar will taste terrible plus from what ive read this raw sugar contains a lot of minerals that are missing in our dietsbr br the product was delivered fast and wellpackaged my only complaint is the price i wish i could find raw sugar cheaper i would be happy to buy in bulk but this is the cheapest i have found,Positive
i thought this was a great buy but as noted by scott d the molasses content was not up to par i loved the higher molasses content sugar in the raw unfortunately what i purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and i have twelve 24 ounce bags i guess ill watch for the next crop,Neutral
i really love this sugar and pricewise its much cheaper to buy it here on amazon compared to anywhere else,Positive
love this sugar it tastes so much better and isnt as overly sweet tasting as regular sugar weve used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good the price that amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff,Positive
cant say anything bad about sugar in the raw i like it better than the other natural sugars better consistency and i know it doesnt matter but better color unfortunately one of the natural paper bags got torn a bit in the box it didnt look like the box was damaged so i cant tell how it happened but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when i opened it not sure what the solution is and id order it again but if it happens again id switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag,Positive
great service items arrived faster than expected very efficient will use this seller again i highly recommend this seller thank you for the excellent service,Positive
please ignore the onestar comments if you check the bag the main ingredient is in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower with anything that is gluten free you have to add another binder which is where the corn flour comes in for someone who has celiac disease and cannot have sunchips because they contain wheat a key binder to any chip cookie or cereal this is an excellent product my spouse and i buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious,Positive
best flavor ever im addicted they are all good but these are by far the best i could live on these and there is no need for anymore to say,Positive
so many healthy products dont taste very good or taste good when you first try them and then go downhill ive had these chips on more than one occasion and they are very tasty ive served them to guests twice and both times they wanted to know what they were and where to get them its also nice to have something glutenfree for friends who are borderline diabeticbut i would eat them anyway,Positive
i found these crisps at our local walmart figured i would give them a try they were so yummy i may never go back to regular chips not that i was a big chip fan anyway the only problem is i can eat the entire bag in one sitting i give these crisps a big thumbs up,Positive
this is one of the best tasting crisps i have ever eaten i only buy it on special occassions because i know ill eat the whole bag,Positive
i paid 179 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today i bought them because brown rice is a good carb as soon as i tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip i checked the ingredients the name is deceptive these have masa corn flour listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste i wont buy these again i can get sunchips for less money and similar taste,Negative
i use the rotel mild and i love this product so muchit saves me on a daily basis if youre trying to cook lower fat healthier foods and in a hurry this stuff makes it so much easier ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird tin can taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever for some reason this product doesnt have that it tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans heat and eatbr br or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup i also make indian dishes with this and spicey spaghetti sauce i also prefer this to most canned salsas so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid offbr br none of my local grocery stores carry it at all nor do they carry anything like it so i have to pay amazons inflated price to order this by the case i dont like that im paying a higher price but i love love love the product,Positive
the price on this product certainly raises my attention on compairing amazon price with the local stores i can get a can of this rotel at my local kroger for 1 dissapointing,Positive
howdy yallbr br the actual product is very good id rate the item a 4 on its own however its only one dollar at the local grocery and twenty eight dollars per twelve pack these are running almost two and a half dollars eachbr br as i said too expensive sigh i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local costbr br take carebr lee,Neutral
nothing wrong with the product but i sure had to mix it with lots of other ingredients to make it edible to me in texas i was called a babymouth not into very spicyhot foodsbr br for comparison im comfortable with tostitos medium chunky salsa 1 can of this milder rotel mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips i used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though,Neutral
this is a fantastic product and i wish it was readily available in most stores its taste is not the greatest but its a 25 oz shot and its gone in a second it tastes more or less like a concentrated sweet tea for the record ive had 5 hour energy and that tastes far worse i will put up the taste for the results its got 150mg of caffeine which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters i cant stand sucralose and sugar substitutes and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it the sugar is at 9g which isnt horrible i used to drink 4 16oz red bulls a day for the caffeine and this gives me far better energy and is much more subtle my preference is black coffee but i cant drink 812 cups a day anymore overall steaz does it right real organic ingredients in moderate amounts and they create big results,Positive
i have to get up really early to work out before work and i get super tired by the middle of the afternoon i was drinking one 5 hour energy usually extra strength each day it worked well but gave me a jittery feeling almost headachy but not quite my husband got me to try this and i was skeptical but for me it works as well if not better than the 5 hour energy and doesnt give me that jittery almostheadache feelingbr br i dont mind the tasteit reminds me of the inside of a fig newton mmm and the price is ok on amazon anyway at my grocery store they were almost 3 each yikebr br and its organicso i can feel good about it right its all about me feeling good,Positive
i bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there he takes one in the mornings and works hard all day good stuff,Positive
i am a energy junkie and im not sure if this works or not but what i do know is that the taste is not the greatest i do drink the steaz energy drink and i think i get the same results i like this products because it is more natural then the others,Neutral
if you want an organic energy shot your choices are this one from steaz and the assorted flavors from guayaki guayaki yerba mate is actually in the steaz energy shot and energy drinks and they both use sambazon acai so there are some similarities in ingredientsbr br great energy burst for 4 hours on a steaz energy shot and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work this will help me cut down on my iced coffees which are not helping my calorie intakebr br already ordering 12packs on subscribe and save 2 per month great value,Positive
i was looking for a natural energy shot that works and i found it steaz energy shot is my favoritebr br i recently had gastric bypass surgery so tons of sugar is a nono and im also allergic to sucralose splenda so most other energy drinks are outbr br i tried bazi energy shots and they didnt work as well as steaz and definitely didnt taste as well these have a taste thats almost like cocacolanot bad at allbr br if youre looking for natural energy give these a try,Positive
i had tried both of the guayaki energy shots and i dont like the taste of either of them this one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better i like them cold for sure my husband and i take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we dont have to make stops for coffee especially on the turnpikes where its just way too expensive its worth the per shot we normally split them im really sensitive to caffeine even the natural kind so i get a little weird if i drink the whole thing but thats the same for coffee too for me my husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost i would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there you can feel good about putting this in your body ill be ordering again soon for sure,Positive
i purchased it because it was on sale in terms of the energy it provides it works but the taste leaves something to be desired i tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable,Neutral
ive been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon as a software engineer this is entirely unacceptable so i asked the nice lady at the counter of my local whole foods market for something that will give me that extra energy i need to get through the daybr br she excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle over three hours after drinking whatever that was my brain is still working at unnatural speeds to summarize my experiences i believe this worksbr br she did explain that i needed to drink plenty of water with it which i personally feel helped the energy level so if youre feeling tired during the day and hate coffee give this a shot preferably before you eat anythingbr br woot,Positive
the energy shot truly does work it had a terrible aftertaste at first but now that i know what to expect i am getting used to it i always have some water handy as a chaserwhich helps i am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy i need without all the chemicals found in other beverages its helped me kick my addiction to diet coke and other aspartamelaced caffeinated beverages yay,Positive
ive tried 5hour energy red rain nos and other energy shots this is my favorite in terms of taste and effect plus its somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredients are used sometimes i wonder what im really putting into my body with some of the other brands i purchase a box about once every 2 months for the past 2 years,Positive
if youre looking for an energy boost without artificial sweeteners and other chemicals this is a great option the taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplift without jitters,Positive
i first found steaz berry energy shots at a local organic market i bought two bottles which cost just under three dollars each i fell in love instantly the drink is delicious i can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea i am very sensitive to sucralose splenda which is in so many energy drinks these days i also hate the taste i love that steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners the rush it gives me is slow and even i have several medical conditions including fibromyalgia which saps me of energy and causes intense pain i like how steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so i can get things done no caffeine jitters even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottlebr it was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores so i started looking online for a bulk price i am so thrilled to have found the pack of 12 on amazon i signed up for amazon prime specifically for this product hah,Positive
i have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energized without any other sides effects at all its also the best taste others taste like medicine this one has a tea fresh taste i love it,Positive
i drive otrover the road truck and this helps to keep me alert it has no sugar high no crash im on a autoship which i like the price is very good ive seen it over 2 bucks in the store,Positive
products takes pretty good and it doesnt leave you gittery with subscibe and save as well as prime membership i pay below 2 a shot my wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style i moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training i recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an awesome energy drink,Positive
i use this product daily and it provides a steady stream of energy i do not get jittery or crash it also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressant,Positive
ive been buying and drinking this for over a year now and the energy boost is excellent with a continuous 6hour effect the most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well or perhaps im getting more used to it i dont drink it for the flavor but its not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other nonorganic energy shots,Positive
this is the first time ive really been misled by other reviews on amazon i like 5hr energy i find rain ok and so i thought id try this product based on the reviews boy am i sorry i gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched really and it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it but worst of all within an hour i was yawning and drowsy unless you really like things that taste of a weird teaflavored cough syrup and dont work dont buy this i dont know what to do with the other 11 bottles big fail,Negative
i loved this mold i wished i could have used it for more than one occasion but it didnt last i did use it to make 30 suckers for my daughters first birthday but there was going to be no way that the mold could be salvaged after that i would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions but for the price it didnt matter to me that much it served its main purpose,Positive
you have to try the vanilla tootsie rolls the regular chocolate ones are good but these are the best ever,Positive
try this you might like it i did and i am quite addicted it is too easy to prepare it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with the price is really good and well worth the purchase if you like this type of couscous like i do then give this one a tryit can be eaten hot room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed i cooked the couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time i will be back for more,Positive
this tricolor couscous is really goodfull of flavor and fun to eat i love the texture i cook in chicken broth and add some minced garlic and chopped herbs parsley cilantro along with some red pepper flakes at the end of cooking i add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dishhighly recommend,Positive
i tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck so i decided to try good ole amazoncom and selected this product it is so goodadd a few herbs and its a great side dish or add more and make a pasta type saladso very good i am hooked great flavor and so easy to prepare,Positive
the package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions i know how i normally cook couscous so tried 34 cup water to 1 cup couscousbrought to a boil and let sit covered for 5min it was mushy and tastelesswe have thrown out the rest of the container,Negative
i wouldnt even think of buying this product unless i know the price per unit how can i compare other items online or in a store,Negative
i love ordering whole bean coffee on amazon i like this so much that this my first product review i have to say that im usually not a big fan of flavored coffee but i thought i would give it a try when my husband started grinding it up i could smell it throughout the house sometimes with flavored coffees the smell is there but the taste isnt however not with this one im now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try,Positive
i love this coffee i do wish it came already ground as i dont have a grinder and use a blender instead but its worth it many flavored coffees ive tried only seem to have a flavored odor that doesnt reach the coffee but this one manages both,Positive
this brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time ive believe the company is local ive been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it im particularly fond of the turtle sundae but all the flavors are good i cant say that ive had a bad onebr br as it turns out its less expensive to order it from amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local walmart to get it its a no brainer try it if you like rich flavored coffee youll like it,Positive
it is hot i love it tasty and a little sweet i usually scoff at salsas labeled as hot but this one lives up to its billing,Positive
i consume about a jar every two weeks of this either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip it is hot but after awhile the medium salsa suprema was too mild for me i thought maybe id cut down how much i ate by going to the hot salsa ranchera its hot enough that people who arent used to it will say thats hotbr br flavor bright and forward the similarly hot salsa victoria is a duller taste to me i guess earthy this salsa is much brighter in the mouth i dont like to go hotter than this because the sauces ive tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot this happens to me with tabasco sauce for examplebr br a drawback is la victoria doesnt make a larger bottle of salsa ranchera nor salsa victoria nor do they sell them in or sams club to get a good deal you have to watch for sales,Positive
service was great but i meant to buy swiss chalet chicken sauce not the marinade br br love the sauce have yet to try the marinade,Positive
use frequently as we like to do asian dishes at least once a week love this product fast shipping as usual would buy again,Positive
these individually wrapped pieces are delicious although i wish there were a few more mildly sweet with no sugarfree aftertaste even a traditional marzipanaholic should enjoy these,Positive
put this in my husbands stocking for christmas and it was a hit,Positive
i was amazed at how quickly it arrived it is a cute stocking stuffer but only ok as far as user appeal you get what you pay for,Neutral
toy was typical quality i expected i got taken for a major ride on the shipping,Neutral
so we cancelled the order it was cancelled without any problem that is a positive note,Negative
i love the convenience of the singles the best creamer aroundtaste is just like the big bottle i can stick them in my purse and take them to work,Positive
these creamers come in 4 packs of 25 i have taken one to work and opened one for home so far and havent found a single broken or leaking creamer yet i usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because i wont allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup i think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping,Positive
even though we are international delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product we had no problem with the shipment but the creamer itself is thinner than international delight other than that we are happy d,Positive
besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers i liked this item specifically because of packaging i couldnt believe how many reviews i read about coffee creamer cups but many of the amazon creamer options both coffeemate and international delight had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packagingbr br that was not an issue here the shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each as shown in the photo those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes thus none of my cups were broken no waste and no sloppy drippy mess plus the four boxes means i could put one in the kitchen one in the bathroom we moved our mini keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen keurig best idea my husband ever had and one at work with a reserve for whichever runs out firstbr br if you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like i was by the negative packaging reviews on other options this is your best bet as a bonus the auto delivery price is very reasonable,Positive
this seller is very nice and the price is very good the only reason i stop ording is bacause i went to sugar free and at that time he did not have it but for those of you that dont have to watch there fat in take i would get this product from them,Positive
i purchased these coffee mate singles to use at work along with the coffee tea bags theyre great because they dont require refrigeration,Positive
i received the items in a timely manner upon receipt i removed a pack to consume the poptart was stale and left an awful taste in my mouth,Negative
i found these new spring poptarts and bought them on a whim my kids and i were amazed and delighted at the fun colorful amazingly detailed artwork on these poptarts fantastic for after school snacks lunch boxes and school treats tie with a ribbon for a bright thinking of you this spring gift the only challenge is finding more in stores way to go kelloggs fantastic product,Positive
yes i am having a cup right now i went all over town looking for this coffee after been invited to a non profit organization to a banquet and besides the delicious food they top it off with this amazing delicious coffee i paid and extra 20 bucks to get it right way and it is worth the money highly recommend,Positive
taste like it is stale will not order this again i had this coffee at a 50th year annerversery at a reception hall and had to have it this stuff tasted nothing like the douwe egberts at the hall this is possibly stale coffee,Negative
serveice delivery with the seller was excellent the product was not will not order again bad taste iam not sure if it was old or that how it tastes i throw it right away i coudl not drink it,Negative
this is honestly the best seasoning salt in all the land it tightens up any dish not spicy just perfectly seasoned its perfect hence my purchase of this 35 oz mamma jamma,Positive
the order arrived as advertised i have had only a few chances to use it but it is awesome the flavor is exactly what i hoped for it may take me a while to finish the entire gallon but i will definnantly order again,Positive
i like a lot of sesame oil and use it in salads regularly great quality flavor and aroma cant beat that its organic,Positive
bought a set of two when my son was about 6 months and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat i cut up cantaloupe apple banana even used sweet potatoes a few times just whatever i could get at the restaurant and it would keep my son busy long enough that i could actually eat its great because i didnt have to be overly worried about him choking on big chunks and he got to try out new foods i wouldnt hesitate to buy this again,Positive
i have a slightly different version of this different brand my son started using it around six months and he really enjoys it he does get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon but whatever anyway i also had trouble cleaning it until i tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush that works pretty well it takes some time but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender or cut it up then clean it up off him the chair the floor the dog me well you get the picture,Positive
what a great idea my daughter love itbr i dont think is difficult to wash i mean is not like just toss water and thats it but come onbr absolutely recommend it,Positive
this product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned i couldnt get the food pieces out to save my life i tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests,Neutral
i loved this product for fruits and other food that i didnt want my new baby to choke on i also used it to put ice in when my baby was teething it worked great for this as well as for the food i didnt like bananas in it thoughimpossible to get clean,Positive
i love love love the idea of this product and my little one loves loves loves to use it she gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and i dont have to worry about her choking the only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out granted some foods are more difficult than others and some dont cause that much of a problem bananas however have pretty much destroyed a couple of them while i love this product i think that next time i will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags,Neutral
the munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product its kind of like sucking on food through a cloth while my daughter was interested in it for a little while she eventually lost interest i may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts,Neutral
this product is amazing i know a few people with little ones that use these and they love them super easy to clean and use when ordering these i was under the impression that there were 2 per packagefyitheyre not only one per,Positive
i ordered these for my coffee themed wedding when they arrived i had to fight off friends because they smelled and tasted so good i literally had to hide the box to the wedding they were a big hit on my wedding day and there were none left over that we put on the tables it was a great tasting product for the lowest price ive seen,Positive
these are delicious the chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose crunchy and not bittera hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb00067ad4uchocolate covered espresso beans 5 poundsa,Positive
the product was exactly as advertised and fresh unfortunately i keep them in a candy dish in the office and they are going fast we need to reorder to keep up with demand,Positive
these chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful the chocolate is very dark and rich and the bean inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing,Positive
popchips are so good i have been following weight watchers and lost 50 pounds and am at my goal these popchips are my salty crunchy indulgence they taste so good,Positive
ive purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix which is a great product by the way this is the highest price ive seen whole foods carries this item and its been on sale there for 999 thats canadian dollars too as im in canada its even cheaper on bakers boxs own website and theyre the company selling this product through amazon for a twopack they should be charging 20 or less what gives i thought amazon was where you could find competitive prices,Positive
the sugar was sweet that can not be denied as advertised it didnt melt when baked either however it will not do for your liege wafflesgaufres what the larger pebbles of belgian pearl will do these grains are smaller think pretzel salt or seed pearls,Positive
thats exactly what i was looking for to bake some chouquettes puffs with small sugar pearls on top works great yum,Positive
this is what i was looking for and was missing it the taste is exactly the taste as the one made in india so just loved it and remember my days back in india definitely recommend it,Positive
i bought this strawberry extract hoping to spruce up a strawberry wine that ended up with less flavor than id original expected a common problem in some fruit winesbr br this is indeed good strawberry flavor just add to your sugary concoction be it a baking good a dessert or a drink to either give strawberry flavor or add to existing flavor and presto just about everyone will be licking their lips and maybe fingersbr br for those interested i found the right addition to a liquid volume to be 4 oz of extract per 1 gallon of liquid,Positive
great stuff and dependable especially when there are a million brands out there to choose from i love the stuff for really high end desires i go with the apollo olive oils from california but i buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again,Positive
i hadnt tried or heard of till recently weavers not its my favorite i am running through the list of types they have looking for a favorite and havent found one yet theyre all so darned smooth no bite no after taste a little pricy but still worth it no worse price wise than starbucks or peets will keep running through the list here and see what happens love them all so far,Positive
having always been a strict peets coffee lover i was reticent to switch brands but weavers won my heart the taste is clean and strong the ethos is correct organic baby and even the packaging is very zen and appropriate be still my caffeinated heart,Positive
go ahead and drink the other brands served at your neighborhood cafe if you must but make sure you have a stash of weavers peru organic whole bean at home to serve up to your friends and family who deserve the best coffee and when you go back to that corner cafe where people drink average coffee because they dont know better take along a travel mug filled with weavers coffee from home and enjoy a real cup of joe er weavers,Positive
a very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream andor honey definately not my cup of coffee oh did i say it was bitter,Negative
im learning that latin american and south american coffees have this distinct coffee caramelish finish as a peets coffee fanatics we learned that weavers roaster was the roaster for peets and we are hooked i already reviewd the french and organic blend but i must say this coffee here is a perfect afternoon drinkbr met the weavers team at the warner brothers party and they gave me a half a pound of french roast since them we are fansbr you wont be dissapointed,Positive
i like eating these whenever i need an energy boostbr it has everything that i am searching for in a to go snackbr fiber plus chocolate is never a bad thing,Positive
these are my favorite bars ever the combo of raisons and dark choc is wonderful very filling these are hard to find in the stores im thankful for subsrcibe and save,Positive
my fiance loves these dark chocolate and nut granola bars and all the grocery stores around us dont carry them anymore once again amazon came through and he couldnt be happier,Positive
i was buying quaker oats granola bars but these nature valley chewy bars are better tasting they make a great snack when im on the go chocolate peanuts and raisinsit doesnt get any better,Positive
hard to get husband to eat breakfast before school he takes two bars now and is very happy to do so it is often hard to find flavor in local grocery stores so again amazoncom came through with a reasonable price now i came keep the husbands breakfast ready as he runs out the door in the mornings i often like to have a bar in the evening as a night snack,Positive
nantucket blend coffee is one of my favorites i was suprised that it was a single box every time i ordered before it was a 2 pack my fault for not reading closer i will not order any more at this price for 1 24 count,Positive

when we received our keurig elite for christmas we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors of the 12 pods we had in the box four were green mountain coffee brand id never tried anything from this company before but from what i had researched online they have the largest range of keurig pods and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as wellbr br unfortunately i was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee we tried their dark magic decaf and breakfast blend and all were underwhelming to say the least i was almost completely set on writing off green mountain altogtherbr br we had one gm pod left and being of the mindset of wastenotwantnot i figured id give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely and im glad i didbr br the nantucket blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee it is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent unlike some of the other gm blends we tried i added some flavored creamer to it and it almost measures up to our goto caribou blend pods almost all in all this is a very standard cup of coffee which while it isnt anything new or exciting is very pleasing and definitely one of the better keurig options weve been able to test out when we run out of all the pods weve accumulated ill probably pick up a box of these as wellbr br now that i know green mountain isnt completely disappointing ill definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffees with our promotion for getting the bewer we ordered a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb004i3y4iegreen mountain coffee golden french toast kcup portion pack for keurig kcup brewers 24counta to try as well and see how it goes from therebr br if youre looking for a goto choice this is your cup,Positive
green mountain is my favorite brand nantucket is my favorite coffee from green mountain very smooth flavor not too strong and not too weak,Positive
i was looking for a replacement for timothys kona blend which is no longer carried on amazon this coffee from green mountain is very nice but not strong enough for me if you like milder coffees then this one is for you,Positive
one of green mountains best blends of coffee in my opinionlove it for your everyday blend perfect stregnth excellent blend,Positive
this is just fantastic chicken noodle soup the best i have ever eaten with large hearty chunks of chickenand vegetables and nice large noodles this soup is just so full bodied and is seasoned just right i am so glad amazon carries this product i just cant find it here in vermont,Positive
i have used this oil for several years and it is the best for eating with bread or cooking i love the regular i use it on everything you wont be sorry you tired it great for dipping bread and cooking omelet and green beans,Positive
oh my gosh is this good like most people ive been eating ketchup my whole life and never really thought anything about it then hubby brought a jar of this home the tomato flavor is amazing i will never buy store ketchup every again,Positive
sir kensingtons did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product the refreshed taste of this ketchup is a great update and now leaves me disappointed when im given heinz while out at a restaurantbr br for you heinz die hard fans out there this is not the ketchup for you but for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in heinz be sure to give this ketchup a trybr br dont forget the spiced variety purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first sir kensington experience is definitely the way to go,Positive
this is ridiculous the best gourmet ketchup i have ever tasted it is pricey but wowlove this stuff it would make a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for but loves their ketchup yummy,Positive
the tomatoes are the star of the classic flavor it is clean and really fresh perfect on an avocado chicken sandwichbr br the spicy flavor is more complex and is the best ketchup i have ever tried it is so good i have now used it on foods that would make me seem crazy,Positive
the spicy version of this ketchup isnt bad but it is too expensive the regular version is sweet as dessert horrible annies organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less even heinz organic is a better deal i gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass not plastic,Neutral
these condiments are overpriced and terrible the classic is disgustingly sweet the spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant,Negative
i have been using porcini mushrooms in my cooking for twenty plus years the roland extra fancy porcinis that i purchased from you are the best that i have ever used including the mushrooms that i bought in italy and transported back to the usa,Positive
i was pretty pleased with these mushrooms they were mostly large pieces rehydrated well and had good flavor id estimate about 25 of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces most likely due to the shaking about in transit not a problem since i sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipes there was a small amount perhaps an ounce or so of very smallmincedsizedustlike pieces still useful to add into gravies and the like nothing gets wastedbr br the label says it is a product of china and italy nothing was specified as to the proportion from each countrybr br im quite fond of dried mushrooms while they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus additionally i find the broth used to rehydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and stews to save time and add flavor i sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without rehydrating them really helps meld all the flavors together i also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling pasta the pasta picks up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroominfused waterbr br this was the first time i used the roland brand got it on a price dip from the amazon warehouse and would certainly buy them again highly recommend,Positive
if you are a peanut lover these are for you much larger than cocktail peanuts six people on my christmas gift list ask for these every year,Positive
the cashews were nice and big with the vast majority being whole there were a number of small pieces at the bottom of the bag but thats pretty expected with so many cashews they made an absolutely excellent cashew brittlebr br my order took just over a week to arrive which was pretty decent considering it was shipped across the country they came double bagged in clear plastic bags and in two 5 lb portions this was highly convenient since i could just throw one of the bags into the freezer until i was ready to work with itbr br great value for the price,Positive
although there were several shriveled ones they taste just fine i mostly use them to make vegan sauces and other recipes that call for running them through a food processor so they dont have to look perfect anyways for the price they are a great deal about half of what i find them for in the store,Positive
i ordered these after a fair bit of searching online even ordering the smaller 13oz bags i will admit i was a bit sceptical when i ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good or bad the cashews would bebr br the order came in pretty fast like 3 days the cashews were fresh and whole with like 10 broken pieces they were in 2 5lb bags sealed with clear tape first i found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal considering the second pack stayed fresh till i opened them the trick is to actually keep them in an airtight box so that they stay fresh longerbr br the only negative i can think of is that the price went up abt 500 for the 10lb since i bought them,Positive
these nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty they are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can,Positive
i bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that i have at a couple of restaurants plus he likes nuts pecans almonds peanuts he loved these i actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin so he could take one to work or his place and stay fresh longer although i dont think freshness will be an issue they wont last longlol,Positive
my cat will go for a day probably longer havent tryed it but hell walk right by this stuff every time even when i know hes hungery absolutely no interest i swear hed rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it,Negative
got this free with another order i placed i couldnt believe how much the cats loved it i will buy again for sure,Positive
this is a great ham soup base i have used it in ham and beans and seasoned greenbeans great flavor,Positive

before i discover this mix on amazon i always bought it in whole food storebr i like this mix and when i am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffybr just one small secret try to add the seltzer water instead of regular one,Positive
i appreciate the fact that i can buy this product online and have free shipping this is a great all around mix that is very good with a wonderful texture thanks again amazon,Positive
arrowhead mills buttermilk pancake mix is my favorite mix it tastes great cooks up light and fluffy and is super easy to make although it can be made using water i think its better made with milk i love it with pure organic maple syrup,Positive
the pancakes taste great without any recipe adjustments for my sons egg allergy its also great for camping or any time youd like to be able to make pancakes without having fresh eggs available,Positive
hey these are great waffles and pancakes we have to add 50 more mix tho as the recipies on the bag are very thin but we have a lot of fun with this arrowhead mills buttermilk pancake waffle mix we serve them as is with fried eggs and real maple syrup a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb002483tsqbutternut mountain farm vermont pure maple syrup grade a dark amber 1 pint juga or with warm strawberry jam and whipped cream or cool whip or add brown sugar to the mix to change the flavor and make a crispy waffle or add 14 cup sugar and 14 cup malted milk powder a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb001eq4hvccarnation malted milk original 13ounce jars pack of 3a for awesome gourmet pancakes and waffles like they serve at the hilton its handy to have extra bags on hand too and you cant beat the subscribe and save price this mix is 70 organic too,Positive
we are glad we found this mix as we make pancakes without eggs for my son who has an allergybr they taste fine for our family we like them many ways,Positive
i love the flour however amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product,Neutral
this mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top there were no tears in the packages,Negative
just awful i thought food was supposed to taste good i had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth its that bad,Negative
perhaps the worst bottle of wine ive ever had im not even sure i would cook with this it is thin no body and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot the taste is just bitter not the complexity that i expect from a pinot noir of any price just not what im looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir maybe my bottle wasnt sealed well and went to vinegar other reviews for this wine are favorable,Negative
a good tasting light chip that has some value in nutrition everyone get the munchiesis this is a good alternative to eating potato chips,Positive
this is a wonderful warm flavored tea especially now in colder weatherbr this tea has a sweetsoothing chamomile fragrance it is subtle and sweetits one of the better chamomile teasbr if you find it hard to sleep at times a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may helpbr if you really like sweet taste try bigelow chamomile mango herbal teabr i highly recommend both,Positive
this is one of the best mint chocolate syrup ive ever had so far the others pale in flavor by comparison there are only seven ingredients in this sauce including organic natural mint flavor in the past i used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch chocolate chips oreo cookies caramel et al because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale now i buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the santa cruz organic mint chocolate syrup really stands out but doesnt overpower the flavor of the ice cream there are only 110 calories and because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste i use it sparingly so this 155 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups i used,Positive
this is a simple product and it is simply good there are no extra ingredients that are hard to pronounce and have you scouring the internet finding out what they are it is a bit thinner consistency than the usual syrup so use caution the first time you go to squeeze some out this will be great for people who like mint it has a much stronger mint flavor than chocolate i use it in my coffee with a bit of half and half tastes great sometimes simple is better,Positive
a grande item delicious fish with the ultimate flavor best ever in a can for all purposes i sent a case to my mother recently diagnosed with diabetes and she loves it as a main entree for cooking patties,Positive
i ordered this product at the same time as the kirkland signature salmon the raincoast trading co salmon is very tasty equally as good quality salmon as the kirkland however the raincoast arrived in perfect condition the kirkland cans were dented badly i recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon,Positive
this tea tastes almost as good as the tea you would get at an indian restaurant its much better than getting a teabag and making it the english way with a lot of water and a bit of milk this is very creamy and tasty my only criticism is that there arent enough sachets in the box only 10 since the directions say that you use one sachet for 100ml of water approximately half a cup its not enough for a good cup of tea so i use two that means that one box is only good enough for five cups of tea but its a delicious afterdinner drink i would buy this again if there were more sachets in a box,Positive
i love this product cant find it locally sometimes little out of the way stores have itbut i also love the chickenpork chop bagsevery store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market,Positive
this is the best way to cook a roast our local grocery went out of buisness and so i could not find this product till i looked here please continue to keep this product available,Positive
its always a pleasure to find frenchs products on the web all of the markets in my area have made a bargain to carry nothing but mccormacks bland and tasteless seasoningsbr br this is the most flavorful cooking bag mix you will ever find,Positive
if you like oreos or the oreo cakester then youve got to try the double stuff cakesters these are the best side note shipping was very slow but maybe your chances will be better,Positive
i was surprised about how good this was my family and friends laughed when i told them i bought this but out of the can ready mix with a little salt pepper spinach and some cheese and its a great easy meal,Positive
the thing about marmite is that those who dont like it hate it and those who love it cant live without it its very much an english thing and the language has even adopted the trade name as a metaphor as in victoria beckham is marmite meaning that those who dont like heretc amazon has done the world a favor by making this weird and wonderful stuff available at an affordable price last time i looked it was 25 a 500g jar in british stores in lacounty or about 4x what it costs in england the amazon supplier was quick and efficient and i now have enough marmite to last me to the end of the year or would have if i didnt decide to send one of the two jars to my son in japan good job amazon,Positive
a vile miserable pancake i put these in front of my toddler one morning and she actually cried i dont know if it was their flat and anemic appearance or their salty bitter taste only the whole wheat flour is organic in this mix the buttermilk baking soda sls and sea salt are not i am going back to natures path buttermilk pancake mix this one went straight into the garbage,Negative
whats there to say about a fantastic chocolate chip cookie the only thing that could be improved is if they offered a bushel box of these so you would not run out so fast hope these dont go the way of the dinosaur,Positive
these arrived on time and packaged in green plastic wrap the cookies were as fresh as the boxes found in the local grocery storebr br i have no complaints but i also now have no more cookies we ate them all,Positive
i was not expecting to like these cookies as much as i do i like chocolate chip cookies well enough but i really prefer a soft cookie to crisp ones i have to say these famous amos cookies have pertty much turned me around the cookies are rich and have that depth of flavor that comes from quality ingredients the chips are real chocolate and melt redilly in your mouth creating a moist experience while chewing these are truly great cookies,Positive
they arent fattening and theyre good for you right thats what i heard at least from an admittedly unreliable person,Positive
great if you are cutting back on fat they do resemble regular chips but are nothing like them extremely dry and hard,Positive
i have never met a kettle brand chip i did not like these chips have a great loaded potato flavor which are flavorful i like the sweet onion chips better but these are also at the top of the list for greattasting potato chips kettle chips are great chips fthe money,Positive
after buying bags one at a time at a hefty markup at nearby stores i decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on amazon i was very pleased with the price and the productsbr br these jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy they have a slowbuilding spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag which im embarrassed to say i did quite a few timesbr br the chips arrived wellpacked and fresh they had nearly a year of time before they expired which is pretty impressive for chipsbr br most importantly the priceperbag was much much better than any local store could do although i live near an expensive city so that may play a role in the price differencebr br i wouldnt hesitate to order another box of these once i run out,Positive
i buy mostly for vending so the size of the bag is important kettles 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full salt vinegar flavor is satisfying about an 8 out of 10,Positive
glad to find these in a one ounce size but the bag seems a bit less than full its hard to find single serving chip bags that vend well sometimes they are too wide or too plump with air bag size is good bbq flavor is about an 8 out of 10,Positive
one of the best chips that you can buyand ive tried all the kettle varieties and many others theres only a slight taste of jalapeno and they are delicious perfect with a sandwich or alonebr if you like being addicted these are the chip for you see you at addicts anonymous,Positive
the title says it all great flavor hint of spice excellent crunch we eat kettle chips by the truck load at my house we like all the flavors but this one far and away is our favorite never enough bags to get us to our next shipment i just wish amazon could get the larger bags on subscribe and save if you buy these make sure you have enough for everyone otherwise you may not get enough for yourself,Positive
wow i have eaten quite a few potato chips in my day kettle chips are the best nonbaked chips i have eaten i decided to try the sweet onion chips since ive never had them i now have a favorite if you like onions this is a must buy i will definitely reorder these as i mentioned above they are the best i have ever eaten the flavor is great,Positive
i cannot say how much i love kettle brand potato chips kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water the ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in i love that these arent filled with nasty chemicals i ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but i was torn between the a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb0048ifusckettle brand potato chips fully loaded baked potato 2ounce pack of 24a and the jalapeno flavor while i know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better they include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which im fine with since ive a vegetarian i ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and i cant guarantee how many i will have left my fiance and i love these the packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches or handing out in gift bags even just for portion control,Positive
now i havent done a sidebyside comparison but these chips still taste like the real deal these snack sized bags do as well as the regular brand at the grocery store i work for portion control and reduced fat yes please with the subscribe save these are much cheaper than at the grocery store,Positive
i love kettle brand chipsbr ive been in love with the honey dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavorsbr br sea salt vinegar chips are tangy sour and make my lips pucker when i eat too many at a time i got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon 11 whatbr br personally the flavor is too much for me but my mom aunt love them and they hate potato chips,Positive
these chips are thick and crunchy i absolutely love them the taste is perfect i like to buy these smaller bags because i cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good,Positive
i enjoy these chips i got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change i think those are better but only slightly like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering the small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag,Positive
i love these chips i buy the 24 pack once a month the bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags the jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor,Positive
these are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips ive had i could still do with more vinegar flavor but i think this is as close as im going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myselfbr br i did a side by side with the cape cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful additionally as other reviewers have said they have quite a good bit of potassium in them somewhere in the neighbor of 15 rda per serving,Positive
i have been ordering the sea salt chips for about a yeari love thembut my daughter picked some of these up at our local grocery store and now they are my new favoritewill be ordering them,Positive
these are my favorite glutenfree dairyfree flavored chips many other salt and vinegar chips contain dairy so its nice to find ones that i can eat the vinegar flavor is really intense and good,Positive
these kettle brand potato chips in the spicy thai flavor really do taste like food i have eaten at a thai restaurant the ingredients listed include garlic powder onion powder parsley jalapeno and spices im not sure what other spices there are but it sure tastes like lemongrass to meyum these chips are thick cut and very crunch they come in a seriously heavyduty bag i tried to open it like i do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart no way the bag is so thick i wondered if it was plastic i started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it sure enough there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions tear here so easy why didnt i think of that,Positive
honey dijon flavor okay flavor but both my girlfriend and i thought they left a bad aftertaste the aftertaste is sort of like old cheese presumably some folks like this im not a fancy cheese eater and it lingers for at least an hour id give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5br br we have also tried the ny cheddar flavor 4 stars which we both liked better and they didnt leave any longlingering or bad aftertastebr br id give the consistency of the chips 4 stars the chips are crunchy but also greasy enough that i keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating kettle chips,Neutral
for me kettle is the best brand on the market they really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods i didnt think anything could top their salt and pepper chips but these are my new favorite the flavors are pure and real they go great with just about everything and are highly addictive i hope they come out with a low fat version their low fat chips are excellent but they need more flavors,Positive
salt and vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip these ones made by kettle were very tasty and i enjoyed them thoroughly i just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste,Positive
what i like about thembr 1 very thick chipsbr 2 no trans fat and all natural according to the info on the bagbr 3 flavor but thats a subjective thingbr 4 2oz bags which keep you from eating too much at one time just set a limit of 1 bagbr br consbr as another reviewer said theres a lot of oil in them chips what i do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off it seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off but its true and at least this way youll get rid of some of the oil,Positive
these are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many a handful or two does the trick very crisp and savory,Positive
i usually love kettle chips and love salt vinegar but these chips were way too vinegary for me they do have the typical kettle chip crunch but are too aggressively flavored for my taste,Neutral
i have always been a fan of kettle chips when you open a bag of kettle chips you know you are going to get quality these chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the packagebr br the new york cheddar chips have a very subtle flavor to them you can taste the cheddar in them but it doesnt smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might the taste lingers as well which is a definite plusbr br another aspect about these kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp that crunch in your mouth on top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags i have had since the purchase the only negative i might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain this isnt a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesnt ruin the bag at allbr br overall the quality of the chips is fantastic the flavor is great and you wont be disappointed especially if you are a cheddar lover,Positive
tried many varieties of bbq chips and hands down these are the best on the market these r not too salty or greasy great crispy crunch plenty of good bbq flavor with a hint of sweetness that all other brands fall short of every bag after bag is just as mouth wateringly delicious as the 1st,Positive
kettle chis are the best ever these used to be my favorite flavor until i tried their salt and pepper kind but im sure this is just a personal preferencebr br crunchy real potato chips,Positive
these chips have the right amount of crunch and i enjoy the taste chips are consistent and have a fairly even distribution of seasoning i like the 2oz size bags just the right amount of chips,Positive
i subscribed to these one case every three months that comes out to about 5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever i want because it seems fritolay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items i want rather than the items fritolay wants me to have the two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the subway for example which i find works very well theyre large enough to be a good snack on their own or you can even share a single bag over lunch the size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh no chip clip neededbr br the only problem i subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones kettle chip consumption definitely have to hide the case from the kids,Positive
oki did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful i took the plunge as i do like salty and tangy flavors no i had never had these before i took the leap and ordered a case at a super price they arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date feb 2011 umm im in the middle on these chips they are ok but not something i cant live without i love the crunch the color no trans fat they are a little too vinegary for my taste which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hardboiled eggs and pickled pigs feetbr br i havent tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience,Neutral
this was the best deal ever the delivery was fast the chips are delicious and very fresh love it,Positive
my husband and i love these chips personally i think the flavor is perfect try them for yourself,Positive
the barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect just spicy enough a hint of sweetness just a little smokey the chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial but not hard this makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers hot dogs or brats chicken or just about any casual entree,Positive
i was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store lunds but they were on sale so i bought a bag ive found that going beyond the simplyflavored chips like cheddar or vinegar usually results in disappointment tried the thai or asianinspired chips by target archer farms and they were awful these kettle spicy thai chips are just awesomeso much so that im considering buying them in bulk from amazon the taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate the taste sensations prevalent in real thai food is baked into this chipsweet salty spicy was sour in there too i dont know but this is a wellmade wellbalanced chip that is addicting,Positive
as a professional potato chip muncher i see these as thee very best on the market rich taste and flavor almost impossible not to finish the entire bagthe true meaning of decadence,Positive
these are handsdown the absolute best salt vinegar chips you can buy they have a great strong flavor that has left me addicted these are certainly my favorite chips i highly recommend trying them,Positive
oh i love these chips and theyre so hard to find where i am and when i do find them theyre usually 12 more per bag for less great that these are so cheap here at amazon,Positive
i love these chips it is a little weird to review potato chips but these chips are great the crunch is just right plus they have just the right amount of salt not to salty not too bland they are a little oily but thats ok the best thing is the 2 oz package when i buy a larger bag its harder to resist eating them all this 2 oz package allows for a little portion control be sure to use your scissors to open cause these chips are packaged for freshness and dont open easily enjoy,Positive
in the past couple years i have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips from the best ive ever had to big disappointments if you have eaten the lantchips varieties there is no way that they are not the best as a group the kettle chips are rightly salted and i was so irritated by some pringles products kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors all in all its good to have choiceamazon does not stock the lantchips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice,Positive
these chips are good and bad and create moral dilemmas constantly if wou are strong at will or having a large bbq go for it but as for me i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it beware,Positive
kettle chips flavors can be hit or miss some of their flavors are terrible but this is very simple and delicious probably one of their best flavorsbr br pros thick crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesnt compromise on taste ecofriendly business that isnt just giving us lip servicebr br cons the occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open they have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time i end up tearing down the entire side of the bag use scissors instead,Positive
we bought these chips at a little sandwich shop in sonoma while we were on vacation i wasnt sure what to expect by the package and at first bite i didnt know what to thinkand then all of the flavors hitbr yum they are a bit spicy but nothing overpowering just lots of crunchy sweet spicy goodness they arent sold everywhere though im still trying to find them somewhere close to where i live,Positive
i have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive i cant stop eating them its crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt just perfect believe me some chips are so salty i cant finish a small bag but this one i just keep on eating,Positive
these are some of the best chips that i have ever had they sure beat anything else out there and are even cooked in a way that is better for you than most other name brands they are tangy and crisp and satisfy any craving at the time these will be the only chips that i buy from now on and i thank amazon for letting me buy them online in bulk and save some money at the same time,Positive
im addicted to salty and tangy flavors so when i opened my first bag of sea salt vinegar kettle brand chips i knew i had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber carrot celery and cherry tomatoes skip the dip balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetablebr br as an oregonian im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends especially those living outside our state and who havent experienced gourmet chips i tell them kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beerbr br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips dont have trans fats msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosherbr br i also recommend a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb000g6mbv4kettle chips honey dijona and a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb000g6q4gmkettle chips spicy thaiabr br annette solomon a reporter for the salem statesman journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips solomon wrote you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy so you would want to select a semisweet white wine also a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger lime garlic and cilantro without overpowering them classically a germanstyle riesling fits these parameters perfectly,Positive
these honey dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty tangy sweet and crunchy other brands ive tried use too much mustard flavor which overpowers the honey dijon pairingbr br these chips make a great side dish on a bbq plate with baked beans coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat naturally they also go down great with beerbr br as an oregonian im proud to share these delectable snacks with friends especially those living outside our state and who havent experienced gourmet chips i tell them kettle brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beerbr br kettle brand potato chips are unmistakablea light gold color rich flavor and amazing crunch kettle brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands kettle brand chips dont have trans fats msg or artificial flavors and colorings the company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified kosherbr br i also recommend these other kettle chips flavors a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb000g6mbuakettle chips sea salt vinegara and a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb000g6q4gmkettle chips spicy thaiabr br annette solomon a reporter for the salem statesman journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips solomon wrote you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing these chips are spicy so you would want to select a semisweet white wine also a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger lime garlic and cilantro without overpowering them classically a germanstyle riesling fits these parameters perfectly,Positive
these chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school they are by far the tastiest chips ive had and its impossible to walk past the aisle without picking up the trademark blue bag and then putting the bag clip on the bag,Positive
these are by far my favorite chips they are extremely crunchy similar to other kettle style chips but its the extreme vinegar flavor that differentiates these from lesser fried potato snacks ive tried several other brands of salt and vinegar and none of them come close,Positive
they are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut i much prefer the salt pepper just for the krinkle cut they have a better texture all around this brand is much better than fritolay and a good price on amazon when you get free shipping these are similar to tims or zacks chips in that they are very crispybr br on a side note these are the hardest bags to open by hand i have to use a knife or scissors everytime,Positive
it took a while to get used to these chips but they are pretty good and more healthy for you they sure were eaten all up by my family and friends,Positive
these are delicious the 2 oz bags are a bit big for school lunches definitely more than a serving,Positive
i recently tried this flavorbrand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are the best thing was that there were a lot of brown chips in the bsg my favorite so i bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends i am a little disappointed that there are not so far very many brown chips in these bags but the flavor is still very good i like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty and the onion flavor is better if you havent eaten kettle chips before i recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk they are thicker and crunchier than lays but just as fresh out of the bag,Positive
we are always pleased with amazons packaging chips are never crushed or broken always fresh we really liked this brandflavor of chips very tasty,Positive
these chips are some of the best ive tasted they are not filled with chemicals you taste the tangy vinegar as well as the potato not greasy perfectly crispy if you dont like salt and vinegar tanginess dont even bother to try these definitely have zip i love them my children and their friends love them even my 4 year old loves them,Positive
these chips were a great deal kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips they are hard to find in vegas and are my favorite flavor shipping was very fast sooner than expected,Positive
fantasticyou can not beat this taste and you can not resist to it only one if you are spice lover,Positive
eat at your own risk once i would open a bag i could not stop good and salty,Positive
i dont eat many chips but these i love great buy and arrived quick and packed great expiration date is a ways away so i have awhile to enjoy them great natural potato flavor i love brown russet hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee,Positive
i simply fell in love with these chips and refused to share them with my friends my experience with a lot of cheesefavored chips has been too salty and a little over the greasy side but these ny cheddar from kettle really changed my mind thanks to amazon for great discounts and i dont have to buy them from the store anymore,Positive
bought this box of chips as a fathers day gift because dad loves them they are very yummy and more substantial than regular chips,Positive
these chips are quite tasty and the price is right packaged very well would buy again,Positive
i like kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked i bought a bigger sized bag from costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly so i dont know why these were differentbr will never buy these chips from here again,Negative
for some reason amazon would not ship these to alaskaso i sent them to my grandchildren who got to enjoy them they are very good chips amazon should rethink the shipping to alaska thing i would order groceries online,Positive
my husband likes these a lot they are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy they are more browner than i would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture not bad though just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health they do have about 12 the calories in fat however,Positive
just got this order and it is ok a bit light on the cheddar flavoring and herb taste eludes me if it is there,Positive
i really love kettle brand chips but these are rather disappointing there is very little sour cream or onion flavor,Negative
i took one and said good russet potato chip but i found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste a bit oily and overcooked it may be because i am use to eating their great tasting a hrefhttpwwwamazoncomgpproductb000g6q4gmkettle chips spicy thai 2ounce bags pack of 24a or perhaps because all the chips in the bags i received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning it is obvious the chips are flavored but if i did not read the bag i would never have thought it had cheddar flavor and i love new york cheddar the flavoring included parmesan cheddar blue cheese garlic and other spices a good chip even when overcooked but i do not plan to buy them again,Neutral
i took one and said good russet potato chip but where is the flavoring then all of a sudden within seconds it spread to my senses and my taste buds were happy as close to thai food as a potato chip can get these chips are spicy enough to satisfy that craving for spice and a hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming the flavoring included garlic ginger jalapeno cilantro and other spices and it just felt great to eat these i will buy these again these were a treat,Positive
i agree with the other review these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums the chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the saltvinegar combo unfortunately every bag i received in that case was over cooked they were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag they definitely need to improve that,Negative
we love kettle chips lightly salted and dont feel guilty eating them we used to buy them at whole foods but buying from amazon has saved us money we have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery,Positive
a friend of mine brought these into work with the claim these will change your life while my life is fairly unchanged i cannot get enough of these chips and i do not even like kettle chips for the most part i find kettle chips to be too thick and greasy but the flavor of these chips is amazing the are the type of hot that is refreshing if you do not enjoy spicy or hot things try these anyway they may convert you,Positive
but if you happen to like me there is no better sea salt and vinegar chip ive found in this country,Positive
these are the best potato chips ive ever tasted its easy to go through half of a bag without stopping the texturecrunchiness is just perfect as is the salt and vinegar combination i dont know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips ive ever had but they do and judging from the nutrition facts they seem to be healthier too theyre somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c which could be because they dont skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normalbr br and if you like these all of the kettle chips are great,Positive
i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them they are really amazing i love cheddar too but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor i recommend them,Positive
this is easily the best potato chip that i have ever had look at the ingredients ginger and 3 types of hot pepper how can you go wrongbr br obviously not for you if you dont like spicy food but if you do like spicy food youll probably love these they have that hotwithahintofsweetness flavor combo that is prevalent in a lot of thai food,Positive
kettle chips spicy thai potato chips have the perfect amount of sweet savory and spicy everything youd want in a good meal or better yeta potato chip since these are kettlecooked the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit overbrowned they are however sliced just perfectly not too thick not too thin so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off the flavor is tremendous although i wouldnt describe it as thai its more of a vague sweet and tangy flavor with a kick and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger if you like any spice at all these really are not overly spicy so most people can handle them the fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any munchers snack cupboard,Positive
okay i should not eat potato chips nor should anyonebr but these are so spicy i would find it hard to eatbr very many that makes them an indulgence thatbr rescues some people from overindulgence,Positive
